"""The loopback bound is a property of the APP OBJECT, not of ``main()``.

The defect this guards is invisible to a test that only calls ``main()`` or only reads
``resolve_bind_host``: the Dockerfile CMD is ``uvicorn complaints_review.api.app:app --host
0.0.0.0``, so a bound that lives only in ``main()`` never runs in a shipped process. Until
this file existed, ``COMPLAINTS_PROFILE=local`` served the seeded persona list, groups and tenant
included, to any peer that could reach the port.

The second half is WHAT the guard is derived from. It must not be the service-to-service
secret. ``COMPLAINTS_S2S_TOKEN`` authenticates a calling SERVICE and no end user, so setting one is
not evidence that ``/v1/personas`` is protected; a guard derived from it switches OFF for
exactly the end-user routes it was protecting. The guard therefore reads the identity BINDING
(``ports/identity.py``), and the token cells below are the standing proof of that.

The guard is keyed on the BINDING rather than the profile string on purpose. This repo's
profile set happens to bind seeded personas only under ``local``, but the settings file is the
thing that decides, and a rebinding changes the answer without the profile name changing at
all. Asking the binding is correct whatever the table currently says.

The control at the bottom keeps the other cells from being true for a boring reason: a
VERIFYING binding must stand the guard DOWN, or "everything refuses" would just mean the guard
is stuck on.
