// The console's Content-Security-Policy, in one module so it is built once and read everywhere.
//
// Emitting it inline in `next.config.mjs` through the static `headers()` table allows exactly
// one directive: `frame-ancestors`. Nothing constrained where a script could
// come from, what a plugged-in `<base>` tag could re-point the relative URLs at, or whether an
// `<object>` could smuggle in a plugin document. The backend middleware in
// `src/complaints_review/api/app.py` covers API responses only; the document a browser actually parses
// and executes is served by Next, so the document-layer policy has to be complete here.
//
// The policy now lives in this module, the nonce is minted per request in `proxy.ts`, and
// `next.config.mjs` no longer emits a `Content-Security-Policy` at all. Two layers both setting it
// would hand the browser two policies to INTERSECT, and the stricter one wins on every directive:
// a nonce-less policy from either layer can block Next's own inline hydration script.
